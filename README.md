# Telecom_company_customer_churn_analysis
This project involves predicting customer churn in the Telco dataset using various machine learning models and a neural network. The goal is to identify customers likely to stop using the service, enabling proactive retention strategies.

# Models Implemented
# 1.Logistic Regression
Why Choose It: A simple and interpretable model ideal for binary classification problems.
Strengths: Fast to train, provides outcome probabilities, and serves as a strong baseline model.
Best Use Case: Linear relationships between features and the log-odds of the target variable.
# 2. Random Forest Classifier
Why Choose It: A robust ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees, reducing overfitting risks.
Strengths: Handles both numerical and categorical data, provides feature importance, and manages non-linear relationships.
Best Use Case: High-dimensional data or datasets with complex feature interactions.
# 3. Gradient Boosting Classifier (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM)
Why Choose It: Builds models iteratively, correcting errors from previous iterations for high accuracy.
Strengths: Provides excellent performance in binary classification tasks and handles missing data well.
Best Use Case: Larger datasets where fine-tuned hyperparameters yield the best results.
# 4. Neural Networks
Why Choose It: Capable of identifying complex patterns and interactions among features.
Strengths: Customizable architecture, scalability, and ability to handle high-dimensional data.
Best Use Case: Large datasets with intricate relationships among features.
Typical Neural Network Configuration:
Input Layer: Matches the number of features in the dataset.
Hidden Layers: One or two layers with ReLU activation for general use cases.
Output Layer: A single neuron with a sigmoid activation function for binary classification.
Loss Function: Binary cross-entropy.
Optimizer: Adam or SGD.
Data Preprocessing
Feature Selection: Selected the most relevant features based on domain knowledge and feature importance scores.
Handling Missing Values: Imputed missing values appropriately.
Normalization/Standardization: Ensured all features are on a similar scale for models requiring it (e.g., neural networks).
Encoding: Converted categorical variables into numerical representations.
Evaluation Metrics
The performance of models is assessed using the following metrics:

# Accuracy: Measures overall correctness of the model.
# Precision: Focuses on true positives among predicted positives.
# Recall: Captures true positives among actual positives.
# F1-Score: Balances precision and recall for an overall performance metric.
# Highest Accuracy Achieved
The Gradient Boosting Classifier achieved the highest accuracy in this project.
